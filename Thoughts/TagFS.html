      <h1>What is a tag-based file system</h1>
      <p>
        Tag-based file system is a concept for a file system that instead of using folders uses tags.
        Usually tag based system is thought of when thinking about how normal files and folders file structure is flawed in a major way: if you have a file that fits under 2 (or more) categories where do you put it? Example: lets say you have a meme thats also cat and folders "cats" and "memes" do you: <br>A) duplicate the image  <br>B) duplicate the folder and put in the diffirent one and put image in the deeper folder?
